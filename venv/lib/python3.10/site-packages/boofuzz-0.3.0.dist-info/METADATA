Boofuzz is a fork of and the successor to the venerable `Sulley`_ fuzzing
framework. Besides numerous bug fixes, boofuzz aims for extensibility.
The goal: fuzz everything.

    :alt: boofuzz screenshot

Why?
----

Sulley has been the preeminent open source fuzzer for some time, but has
fallen out of maintenance.

Features
--------

Like Sulley, boofuzz incorporates all the critical elements of a fuzzer:

-  Easy and quick data generation.
-  Instrumentation – AKA failure detection.
-  Target reset after failure.
-  Recording of test data.

Unlike Sulley, boofuzz also features:

-  Online `documentation`_.
-  Support for arbitrary communications mediums.
-  Built-in support for serial fuzzing, ethernet- and IP-layer, UDP broadcast.
-  Better recording of test data -- consistent, thorough, clear.
-  Test result CSV export.
-  *Extensible* instrumentation/failure detection.
-  Much easier install experience!
-  Far fewer bugs.

Sulley is affectionately named after the giant teal and purple creature
from Monsters Inc. due to his fuzziness. Boofuzz is likewise named after
the only creature known to have scared Sulley himself: Boo!

Changelog
=========

v0.3.0
------
Features
^^^^^^^^
- Memory optimization: Efficient mutation generation and smarter string reuse -- decrease memory consumption by orders of magnitude.
- `Aligned` block: Aligns content length to multiple of certain number of bytes.
- Relative names: Name references for `Checksum`, `Size`, etc. now resolve absolute and relative names. Block and primitive
  names no longer need to be globally unique within a message, they only need to be locally unique within a block.
- Passing data between messages: Callbacks now have a `TestCaseContext` object to which one can save data to be used
  later in the test case. `TestCaseSessionReference` can be passed as a default value in a protocol definition. The name
  it references must have been saved by the time that message in the protocol is reached.
- `Fuzzable` rewrite: Simpler definitions for new fuzz primitives. See `static.py` for an example of a very simple primitive.
- Protocol definition: Protocols can now be defined with an object oriented rather than static approach.
- Independent mutation and encoding steps: Will enable multiple mutations and code coverage feedback.
- Procmon: Additional debug steps. Partial backwards compatibility for old interface.
- `ProcessMonitorLocal` allows running procmon as part of fuzzer process.
- Network monitor: improved network interface discovery (Linux support).
- Added support for fuzzing Unix sockets with the `UnixSocketConnection` class.
- Added metadata to ProtocolSession to support callbacks -- `current_message`, `previous_message`.
- All primitive arguments are now optional keyword arguments.

Fixes
^^^^^

- Fixed CSV logger send and receive data decoding.
- Handle SSL-related exception. Added `ignore_connection_ssl_errors` session attribute that can
  be set to True to ignore SSL-related error on a test case.
- Fixed `s_from_file` decoding in Python 2 (the encoding parameter is now depreciated).
- Updated documentation of `s_checksum`. It is possible to use a custom algorithm with this block.

v0.1.5
------
Features
^^^^^^^^
- New curses logger class to provide a console gui similar to the webinterface. Use the session option `console_gui` to enable it.
  This has not been tested under Windows!
- Compatibility for Python 3
- Large test cases are now truncated, unless a failure is detected.
- When a target fails to respond after restart, boofuzz will now continue to restart instead of crashing.
- New Session option `keep_web_open` to allow analyzing the test results after test completion.

- Fixed a dependency issue in installation.


v0.1.3
------
Features
^^^^^^^^
- Socket Connections now allow client fuzzing.
- Log only the data actually sent, when sending is truncated. Helps reduce database size, especially when fuzzing layer 2 or 3.
- `Target` `recv` function now accepts a `max_recv_bytes` argument.

Fixes
^^^^^
- Fixed install package -- now includes JavaScript files.

v0.1.2
------
Features

    - Cool left & right arrow buttons to move through test case
- New ``Session`` parameter ``receive_data_after_fuzz``. Controls whether to execute a receive step after sending
  fuzz messages. Defaults to False. This significantly speeds up tests in which the target tends not to respond to
  invalid messages.

v0.0.13
-------
Features
^^^^^^^^
- Web UI
    - Test case numbers are now clickable and link to test case detail view.

      killed before being attached
- Logging Improvements
    - ``Target`` ``open()`` and ``close()`` operations are now logged.
    - Added some optional debug output from boofuzz runtime.
    - Improve capability and logging of messages' ``callback`` methods.

    - Add ``Session`` ``receive_data_after_each_request`` option to enable disabling of data receipt after messages are sent.
    - ``Session`` ``skip`` argument replaced with ``index_start`` and ``index_end``.
    - ``Session`` now has separate crash thresholds for elements/blocks and nodes/messages.
    - Give ``SocketConnection`` separate timeouts for ``send()``/``recv()``.
- Ease of Use
    - ``Target.recv()`` now has a default ``max_bytes`` value.
    - Added ``DEFAULT_PROCMON_PORT`` constant.

- Unix and Windows process monitors now share much more code.

Development
^^^^^^^^^^^
- Added unit tests for ``BitField``.
- Cleaned up CSS on web pages.
- Added a unit test to verify restart on failure behavior

0.0.12
------
Features
^^^^^^^^
- Test cases now have descriptive names
- Added Session methods to fuzz a test cae by name: ``fuzz_by_name`` and ``fuzz_single_node_by_path``

-----
Features
^^^^^^^^
-  Console output - now with colors!
-  process_monitor_unix.py: added option to move coredumps for later analysis.
-  The process monitor (procmon) now tracks processes by PID by default rather than searching by name. Therefore,
   stop_commands and proc_name are no longer required.
-  SIGINT (AKA Ctrl+C) now works to close both boofuzz and process_monitor.py (usually).
-  Made Unix procmon more compatible with Windows.
-  Improved procmon debugger error handling, e.g., when running 64-bit apps.
-  Windows procmon now runs even if pydbg fails.
-  Added ``--help`` parameter to process monitor.
-  Target class now takes ``procmon`` and ``procmon_options`` in constructor.
-  Added example fuzz scripts.

Fixes
^^^^^
-  SIGINT (AKA Ctrl+C) now works to close both boofuzz and process_monitor.py (usually).
-  Fixed: The pedrpc module was not being properly included in imports.
-  Made process_monitor.py ``--crash_bin`` optional (as documented).
-  Improved procmon behavior when certain parameters aren't given.
-  Improved procmon error handling.
-  Fixed a bug in which the procmon would not properly restart a target that had failed without crashing.

0.0.7
-----
Features
^^^^^^^^
-  Added several command injection strings from fuzzdb.
-  Blocks can now be created and nested using ``with s_block("my-block"):``

Fixes
^^^^^
-  Fixed pydot import error message

0.0.6
-----
Features
^^^^^^^^
-  Added ``Request.original_value()`` function to render the request as if it were not fuzzed.
   This will help enable reuse of a fuzz definition to generate valid requests.
-  ``SocketConnection`` can now send and receive UDP broadcast packets using the ``udp_broadcast`` constructor
   parameter.
-  ``Target.recv()`` now logs an entry before receiving data, in order to help debug receiving issues.

Fixes
^^^^^
-  Maximum UDP payload value was incorrect, causing crashes for tests running over UDP. It now works on some systems,
   but the maximum value may be too high for systems that set it lower than the maximum possible value, 65507.
-  ``SocketConnection`` class now handles more send and receive errors:  ``ECONNABORTED``, ``ECONNRESET``,
   ``ENETRESET``, and ``ETIMEDOUT``.
-  Fixed setup.py to not include superfluous packages.

Development
^^^^^^^^^^^
-  Added two exceptions: ``BoofuzzTargetConnectionReset`` and ``BoofuzzTargetConnectionAborted``.
-  These two exceptions are handled in ``sessions.py`` and may be thrown by any ``ITargetConnection`` implementation.

0.0.5
-----
Fixes
^^^^^

0.0.3
-----
-  Fixed deployment from 0.0.2.
-  Simplify CONTRIBUTING.rst for automated deployment.
-  tox no longer runs entirely as sudo. The sudo has been moved into tox.ini and is more fine-grained.
-  Reduced default ``Session.__init__`` ``restart_sleep_time`` from 5 minutes to 5 seconds.

0.0.2
-----
Continuous deployment with Travis.

Development
^^^^^^^^^^^
-  Added build and PyPI badges.
-  Added CONTRIBUTING.rst.
-  check-manifest now runs in automated build.
-  Travis now deploys to PyPI!

0.0.1-dev5
----------
Development
^^^^^^^^^^^
-  Tests now run on tox.
-  Added Google Groups and Twitter link.

0.0.1-dev4
----------

Fixes
^^^^^
-  Missing property setters in ``boofuzz.request.Request`` now implemented.
-  Unit tests now pass on Windows.
-  Fixed wheel build issue; boofuzz subpackages were missing.

0.0.1-dev3
----------

Fixes
^^^^^
-  Session constructor param ``session_filename`` is now optional.

0.0.1-dev2
----------
New features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Now on PyPI! ``pip install boofuzz``
-  API is now centralized so all classes are available at top level
   ``boofuzz.*``

   -  This makes it way easier to use. Everything can be used like
      ``boofuzz.MyClass`` instead of ``boofuzz.my_file.MyClass``.

-  Added ``EzOutletReset`` class to support restarting devices using an
   ezOutlet EZ-11b.

Backwards-incompatible
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Target now only takes an ``ITargetConnection``. This separates
   responsibilities and makes our code more flexible with different
   kinds of connections.

Fixes
^^^^^

-  Bugs fixed:

   -  ``helpers.udp_checksum`` was failing with oversized messages.
   -  Missing install requirements.
   -  Grammar and spelling.
   -  ``setup.py`` was previously installing around five mostly unwanted
      packages. Fixed.
   -  Removed deprecated unit tests.
   -  Removed overly broad exception handling in Session.
   -  ``Checksum.render()`` for UDP was not handling dependencies
      properly.

Back-end Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section took the most work. It has the least visible impact, but
all of the refactors enable new features, fixes, and unit tests.

-  Primitives and Blocks:

   -  Created ``IFuzzable`` which properly defines interface for
      ``Block``, ``Request``, and all ``BasePrimitive`` classes.
   -  Made effectively private members actually private.
   -  Eliminated ``exhaust()`` function. It was used only once and was
      primarily a convoluted break statement. Now it's gone. :)
   -  Split all block and primitive classes into separate files.

-  Many Unit tests added.

Other
^^^^^

-  Continuous integration with Travis is running!
-  Doc organization improvements.
-  Can now install with extras ``[dev]``

Initial Development Release - 0.0.1-dev1
----------------------------------------


-  Much easier install experience!
-  Support for arbitrary communications mediums.

   -  Added serial communications support.
   -  Improved sockets to fuzz at Ethernet and IP layers.

-  Extensible instrumentation/failure detection.
-  Better recording of test data.

   -  Records all sent and received data
   -  Records errors in human-readable format, in same place as
      sent/received data.

-  Improved functionality in checksum blocks.
-  Self-referential size and checksum blocks now work.
-  ``post_send`` callbacks can now check replies and log failures.
-  Far fewer bugs.
-  Numerous refactors within framework code.
